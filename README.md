# Getting Started
## Install [CocoaPods ](https://cocoapods.org/)
CocoaPods is a package management tool for iOS and macOS development. We use it to add the actual React Native framework code locally into your current project.
* We recommend installing CocoaPods using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
  $ brew install cocoapods

* In Project Directory:
    yarn install / npm install
